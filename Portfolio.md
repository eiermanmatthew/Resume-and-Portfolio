Price Comparison Tool for Funeral Home Services

What problem are you solving?
Consumer Pricing Discovery for Funeral Industry Services, even with a federal open data mandate pricing has historically only given pricing in person or over phone/fax.

What is your solution?
Web 2.0 Price Comparison Tool (Geocoded, Data Analysis, Search, Dynamic) to help funeral homes and consumers find each other and have the information to make a good match/decision.

How is this better than alternatives?
We have done customer discovery interviews to find out. Currently consumers go to the funeral parlor they know, and pricing is made available by request. If a consumer is in a time of need, or are pre-planning, they must walk in or call multiple funeral homes to request pricing data then compare the funeral homes services based on a 2-16 page pdf general price list or review several funeral packages. Sometimes this can be a stressful event if at a time of need. Consumers may not know they can save $2,000 in your funeral costs just by crossing the street.

Imagine being one of the 3.5 million consumers looking at funeral home services annually. Then being able to use Parlor from the privacy of your own computer or cell phone. You can look at 19,500 funeral homes pricing and service offerings and make comparisons. Allowing consumers to privately review this information before making any decisions, regardless of immediate need or preplanning. Allowing consumers to have access to compare pricing before engaging with funeral home staff.
